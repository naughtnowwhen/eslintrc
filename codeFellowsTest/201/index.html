    // So how should this look like? 
    // information is prompted to the user for them to respond to. Should info be alerted, or on the page already? Should an alert with info be followed by a prompt immediately with their response? 
    
    // then how should their questions and answers be paired together? Two arrays that are aligned in a for loop, one with the questions, one with the answers? 

    // Or an object where each question is a property and each value is the answer.

// // alert(infoStore[x]);
// answerStore.push(prompt(questionStore[x]));

// alert("here is some info to consider");
